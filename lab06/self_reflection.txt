You must answer at least 4 questions, but the remaining ones are optional. The main goal of this file is to get you thinking critically about your own work, but we will also use these self reflections at the end of the semester when we do our internal review of the course.

ArrayDeque:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A:

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A: I was proud of my get() method since I thought it was a very simple solution and didn't take up too many lines.

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A: I felt that the code for my resize() method was long and somewhat inelegant since it individually copied each element to the new array.

Q: What did you learn by talking to your partner about writing ArrayDeque?

A:

Q: What do you wish you would have known before writing ArrayDeque, if anything?

A: I wish I would've known a better way to keep a track of which elements are at the front and the back of the deque.

Q: If you wrote ArrayDeque again, what would you do differently, if anything?

A: I'd try to refine my resizing code since I felt that it took up many lines in an unnecessary fashion and I could simplify it.

LinkedListDeque:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A: 

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A: I was proud of how my code was able to cleanly add elements without the need for many lines.

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A: I thought that the get() method I wrote had many lines and a somewhat inelegant implementation that could have potentially been simplified.

Q: What did you learn by talking to your partner about writing LinkedListDeque?

A:

Q: What do you wish you would have known before writing LinkedListDeque, if anything?

A: I wish I would've known other approaches for the LinkedListDeque, so I could potentially try other ways to implement the methods.

Q: If you wrote LinkedListDeque again, what would you do differently, if anything?

A: If I were to write LinkedListDeque again, I'd most likely try to refine my get() method since it was somewhat inelegant and I could try and simplify it.

Meta:

Q: Did you like this design review process? Anything we should do differently next time?

A: I thought it was a good process, it could potentially have a slightly greater emphasis on the number of lines of code (for fun, not a grade) just to see how to make the code as simple as possible.
